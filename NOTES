BUGS:
  -- [FIXED?!] -- Sometimes Player Can't Move Left/Right when Perfectly Lined Up with the Block Below it
    -- When the Player is On the Ground, it tries to Move left/right and down due to gravity all at the Same time
        This Causes the Vertical Displacement to Collide with the Adjacent Block, Overriding the Horizontal Displacement
        -- For Now, Making the Player Only Move Left/Right while on the Ground Seems to Fix this
          -- But, Another Check to See if the Player is On the Ground is Required, Otherwise the Player Might Lose A DoubleJump Randomly
  -- Changing the Width of the Player in its Constructor Makes it Able to Pass through Walls?
  

FIXED BUGS:
  -- FIXED! -- ANDROID -- Sliding Between Touch_Buttons Before Releasing will Cause Breakage,
    -- Created Hash Table with touch ID keys and Touch_Button References as Values
    -- Each Time a love.touchmoved event happens, the old value is looked up in the Table and
        if the Current Touch_Button is the Same, then nothing is done, otherwise
      -- Maybe Add in Check with love.touch.touchmoved() or Redo love.touch.touchreleased()
      -- OR Use only One Single Touch_Button for Both Left and Right Movement
      -- Use love.touch.touchpressed()[id] as Hash Table Keys and Buttons as Values
        -- Use love.touch.touchmoved()[id] to change old Button to be Released and
          -- Check for New Button Press


TODO:
  -- [DONE!] Add Camera Scrolling Support
