NOTES:
-- In bump.lua ny < 0 Means the Other Object is Below
--              ny > 0 Means the Other Object is Above
--
-- On Embedded Platforms ( Like the GCW0 ) and some Slower Devices, 
	-- Using love.graphics.rectangle("line", ...) Slows the Game Down to be Unplayable at times
  -- Added new fastDraw() Functions that Avoid using love.graphics.rectangle("line", ...)
    -- They Only Activate Once a Slowdown is Detected
-- Added OB_Gate, a Gate that Closes once a Player Goes through it, Code GT
-- Added OB_Lightning_Gate that Becomes Deadly only After the Player has been through it once
  -- Codes: LG - Full Block Lightning Gate
  --        LGH - Horizontal Lightning Gate, Similar To Horizontal Lightning
  --        LGV - Vertical Lightning Gate, Similar To Vertical Lightning
-- Maybe Add "Doors"/Gates that Open Only Once a "Key" of the Same Color is Found
  -- Or Maybe Just One Color ( At least to Start )
-- Remove/Replace other.class.name == "xxxx" in Player.lua and Other Files, Replace with Booleans
  -- Hopefully Should improve Speed, but With How Lua May Work, I suppose this Isn't a Guarantee



BUGS / NITPICKS:
  -- Changing the Width of the Player in its Constructor Makes it Able to Pass through Walls?
  -- The Naming Scheme I chose for X/Y/L/T is Confusing and Not Followed Well
     -- I've got to figure out one Way and Stick to it
     --  Ex. OB_Cannon.directionY is Positive for Down
        -- While Player.velocityY is Positive for Up
  -- Menu Update Killed Android Support
    -- Now Appears to Run without Input but Without Errors
    -- The Touch Buttons No Longer Work
      -- Reset to Controlling Player Directly through Touch_Button.lua ( No Trying to Send Keypress ? )
        -- Could Use Touch_Button.game to tell what State the Game is in and Choose Appropriate Action
      -- OR (IDEAL) Send (Fake) Keypress through Game:keypressed(), Keeping thing Easier to Work With
  
POSSIBLY FIXED BUGS:
  -- [Fixed?] - Falling Blocks Can Freeze + FC Game?  Not sure Why...
  -- [Fixed?] - OB_Cannons Shooting Player Below Bottom of Map Can Cause Player to Appear to be Stuck within the Cannon
    -- Haven't Seen this Since Some Bug Fixes
    -- Player Re-enters Cannon Upon death, not sure how
      -- player.isAlive = false
      -- player.flying = true


FIXED BUGS:
  -- [FIXED!] - OB_Lightning_Gates Sometimes kill the player on their first pass through, at least when fired by Cannons
    -- Problems in OB_Gate Base Code, MAKE SURE ALL FIELDS ARE SET! ( self.solid and self.deadly weren't set correctly )
/bin/bash: .NOTES.swp: command not found
  -- [FIXED!] -- Sometimes Player Can't Move Left/Right when Perfectly Lined Up with the Block Below it
    -- When the Player is On the Ground, it tries to Move left/right and down due to gravity all at the Same time
        This Causes the Vertical Displacement to Collide with the Adjacent Block, Overriding the Horizontal Displacement
        -- For Now, Making the Player Only Move Left/Right while on the Ground Seems to Fix this
          -- But, Another Check to See if the Player is On the Ground is Required, Otherwise the Player Might Lose A DoubleJump Randomly
  -- [FIXED!] -- ANDROID -- Sliding Between Touch_Buttons Before Releasing will Cause Breakage,
    -- Created Hash Table with touch ID keys and Touch_Button References as Values
    -- Each Time a love.touchmoved event happens, the old value is looked up in the Table and
        if the Current Touch_Button is the Same, then nothing is done, otherwise
      -- Maybe Add in Check with love.touch.touchmoved() or Redo love.touch.touchreleased()
      -- OR Use only One Single Touch_Button for Both Left and Right Movement
      -- Use love.touch.touchpressed()[id] as Hash Table Keys and Buttons as Values
        -- Use love.touch.touchmoved()[id] to change old Button to be Released and
          -- Check for New Button Press
  -- [FIXED!] Unbearably slow on map3.txt on GCW0
    -- Not Drawing Lightning Obsticals Seems to Fix this
    -- Don't Over-use love.graphics.rectangle("line",...) on Embedded/Slower Devices
  -- [FIXED!] - OB_Cannons Can't Seem to Shoot Directly Up
    -- FIXED - Forgot to Remove Debug Test in Player:shootCannon(), Caused Player to Go Below Cannon Instead of Above
  -- [FIXED!] - OB_Cannons Can Cause Player to Die When Trying to Exit Up from Bottom of Level
    -- FIXED - Player:enterCannon() set Player.l and Player.t but Didn't Actually Call world:move() on Player
      -- It looks like the Player would overshoot the Cannon and Visually enter the Cannon, 
          but When trying to shoot out, They would Pass through a Deadly Obstical Next to the Cannon During Move
    -- Player.t > Map.height, not sure why


TODO:
  -- Add 10th Map
  -- Improve Check for FastDraw to Use a Running Average FPS, rather than Picking up a Dip over One Frame
  -- Remove Debug Keyboard Shortcuts in Map.lua
  -- Touch_Button on Android for Escape to Menu / Quit
  -- Make Touch_Buttons Use game:keypressed()/keyreleased() instead of Directly Affecting Player
    -- Should Make Touch Buttons Work for Menus

DONE:
  -- [DONE!] Add Camera Scrolling Support
  -- [DONE!] Add 4th Map
  -- [DONE!] Add 5th Map
  -- [DONE!] Add 6th Map
  -- [DONE!] Add 7th Map
  -- [DONE!] Add 8th Map
  -- [DONE!] Add 9th Map
  -- [DONE!] Add Menu System ( Started, but Needs Research )
  -- [DONE!] Simple Idea for Menu System:
    -- Shows each Map/Level Full-Screen (Except Possibly for Touchscreen Buttons) One at a Time 
    -- Maps can be switched between with Player 1 Right/Left Keys/Buttons
    -- Currently Viewed Map Can Be Selected with Jump Button
    -- Doesn't Call the Map's update() function
    -- Menu is Inherited from Map
  -- [DONE!] Basic / Haxor way to Go back a level:
    -- Pseudo-Code:
    -- function Map:prevLevel()
      -- if Map.levelNum > 1 then
        -- Map.levelNum = Map.levelNum - 2
        -- Map:nextLevel()
      -- else
        -- Warning: No Previous Level
          -- Or just: Don't Change
