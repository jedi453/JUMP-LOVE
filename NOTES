BUGS:
  -- Sometimes Player Can't Move Left/Right when Perfectly Lined Up with the Block Below it
  -- Changing the Width of the Player in its Constructor Makes it Able to Pass through Walls?
  -- ANDROID -- Sliding Between Touch_Buttons Before Releasing will Cause Breakage,
      -- Maybe Add in Check with love.touch.touchmoved() or Redo love.touch.touchreleased()
      -- OR
