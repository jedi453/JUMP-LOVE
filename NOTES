NOTES:
-- In bump.lua ny < 0 Means the Other Object is Below
--              ny > 0 Means the Other Object is Above
--
-- On Embedded Platforms ( Like the GCW0 ) and some Slower Devices, 
	-- Using love.graphics.rectangle("line", ...) Slows the Game Down to be Unplayable at times
-- Added OB_Gate, a Gate that Closes once a Player Goes through it, Code GT



BUGS:
  -- Changing the Width of the Player in its Constructor Makes it Able to Pass through Walls?
  -- Unbearably slow on map3.txt on GCW0
    -- Not Drawing Lightning Obsticals Seems to Fix this
  

FIXED BUGS:
/bin/bash: .NOTES.swp: command not found
  -- [FIXED!] -- Sometimes Player Can't Move Left/Right when Perfectly Lined Up with the Block Below it
    -- When the Player is On the Ground, it tries to Move left/right and down due to gravity all at the Same time
        This Causes the Vertical Displacement to Collide with the Adjacent Block, Overriding the Horizontal Displacement
        -- For Now, Making the Player Only Move Left/Right while on the Ground Seems to Fix this
          -- But, Another Check to See if the Player is On the Ground is Required, Otherwise the Player Might Lose A DoubleJump Randomly
  -- [FIXED!] -- ANDROID -- Sliding Between Touch_Buttons Before Releasing will Cause Breakage,
    -- Created Hash Table with touch ID keys and Touch_Button References as Values
    -- Each Time a love.touchmoved event happens, the old value is looked up in the Table and
        if the Current Touch_Button is the Same, then nothing is done, otherwise
      -- Maybe Add in Check with love.touch.touchmoved() or Redo love.touch.touchreleased()
      -- OR Use only One Single Touch_Button for Both Left and Right Movement
      -- Use love.touch.touchpressed()[id] as Hash Table Keys and Buttons as Values
        -- Use love.touch.touchmoved()[id] to change old Button to be Released and
          -- Check for New Button Press


TODO:
  -- [DONE!] Add Camera Scrolling Support
  -- [DONE!] Add 4th Map
  -- [DONE!] Add 5th Map
  -- Add 6th Map
  -- Add 7th Map
  -- Add Menu System ( Started, but Needs Research )
